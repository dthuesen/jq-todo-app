# Setup Instructions

- `npm i` in both directories server and client
- cd into the 'server' directory and run the server with `nodemon` or `node app.js`
- cd into the client directory and run the command `gulp` for making sure the app is transpiled 
- then run an http server in the client directory e.g. with the command `python -m http.server 8000`
- now open a browser on `http://localhost:8000` and the app should run without problems
